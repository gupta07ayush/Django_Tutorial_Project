''' @gupta07ayush
WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface, 
and ASGI stands for Asynchronous Server Gateway interface. 
They both specify the interface and sit in between the web server 
and a Python web application or framework.
One of their jobs is to handle incoming requests from the client.
 WSGI will process the requests sequentially, .
 it will carry out the instructions step-by-step, one after the other.
Remember that we process requests asynchronously. 
So requests donâ€™t have to wait on the others before it to finish.
